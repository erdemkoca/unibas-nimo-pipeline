- LassoNet and Randomforest not performing good:
  - overfitting maybe
- Traing Loss also saving in the result
  - also plots for this to see if its overfitted
  - or if both train and test loss are similar
- Use different synthetic dataset
  - where nonlinearity is good and linearity models dont perform good
  - fast run of Logisticregression and Randomforest (NN)
  - find the settings where we have scenarios wher linear model not performing good
    - so that nimo is outperforming then with non-linear correction
- Find other real dataset
  - search on kaggle
  - like moonset dataset etc
- Zeig unterschied zwischen Baseline und NIMO


Real dataset:
1. Moons Dataset (synthetic, 2D classification)
2. Circles Dataset (synthetic, concentric rings)
3. XOR Dataset (synthetic, 2D)
4. MNIST Digits (real, 28×28 images)
5. CIFAR-10 (real, 32×32 color images)
6. Higgs Boson Dataset (UCI, physics data)



Trennen:
- abhängigkeiten und nicht linearitäten
