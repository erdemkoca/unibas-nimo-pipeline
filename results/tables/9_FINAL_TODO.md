FIX Synthetic Datasetss:
***
- A (pure linear)
- B (typical interaction -> MLP Outperforming all)

**
- C (NIMO_T > NIMO_MLP)



PLAN:


- ASK EVERYTHING IN THESIS TO AI IF ITS OKAY!

- Finish MLP-Transformer Implementation
- Run Real Datasets (10 + 30iteration)
- Find NIMO_T specific synthetic scenarios and Test - Right th transformer in thesis finsih it
- Run Synthetic Dataset
- Write NIMO_T last part (Lessons Learned, how achieved)
- Finish Result section (real dataset) + Wilcoxon + SummaryTable - WRITING
- Finish Result section (synthetic dataset) + Wilcoxon + SummaryTable
- Finish Runtime-Plot Section
- Make best F1 for all Scenarios + Datasets Table 2 of them, ( with points above maybe alreay done)


Bonus:

- Make Synthetic Plots nicer (hleper axes, Orange color not nice, red-best-f1 lines not correct, zero coefficients too much -> not readable)
- Maye fc first layer Plots
- Bonus stuff

TODO:

- finish thesis writing (all TODOs) BUT not nimo_t and nimo_mlp stuff

- nimo_MLP adaption make it better
- make nimo more sparse set to zero more if its a little bit small, more penalty, adapt nimo to be more sparse like lassso (more zero coefficient)

- write nimo_T vs nimo_MLP

- make paired f1 boxplot for all scenarios NIMO_T and NIMO_MLP

Maybe:

- shap try to find nonlinearities interaction out of nimo nn corrections.
- future: make one very high dimensional setting: Example: 300 samples (n=300) with 10,000 genes as features (p=10,000).

- make for nimo heatmap of neurons first fc layer etc
- report theresidual error for nimo too

- adapt NN to be like RF (Prio 0)


# Detec nonlinearity and interaction in Nimo

Short answer: **yes**—you can tell “mostly interaction” vs “mostly univariate nonlinearity,” and NIMO actually gives you two clean signals to do it.

### How to separate the two ideas

1. **Use derivatives of the logit η(x)\eta(x)η(x).**
    
    Your NIMO logit is
    

η(x)=β0+∑jβj xj(1+gj(x−j)).\eta(x)=\beta_0+\sum_j \beta_j\,x_j\bigl(1+g_j(x_{-j})\bigr).

η(x)=β0+j∑βjxj(1+gj(x−j)).

- **Interaction (between jjj and kkk)** shows up in the **mixed partial**pairwise interaction∂xj∂xk∂2η=βj∂xk∂gj(x−j)(and sym. βk∂xj∂gk).
    
    ∂2η∂xj ∂xk⏟pairwise interaction=βj∂gj(x−j)∂xk(and sym. βk∂gk∂xj).\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x_j\,\partial x_k}}_{\text{pairwise interaction}}
    = \beta_j \frac{\partial g_j(x_{-j})}{\partial x_k}
    \quad(\text{and sym. } \beta_k \frac{\partial g_k}{\partial x_j}).
    
    If this is large (on average over the data), you have interaction.
    
- **Univariate nonlinearity** shows up in the **second derivative**univariate curvature∂xj2∂2η.
    
    ∂2η∂xj2⏟univariate curvature.\underbrace{\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x_j^2}}_{\text{univariate curvature}}.
    
    - With **strict no-self** gj ⁣̸ ⁣\dependsonxjg_j\!\not\!\dependson x_jgj\dependsonxj, this curvature is **zero** (so NIMO, by design, *doesn’t* model self-nonlinearities—only cross-feature modulation).
    - In your relaxed implementation (no strict mask), gjg_jgj may depend a bit on xjx_jxj; then ∂2η/∂xj2≠0\partial^2\eta/\partial x_j^2\neq 0∂2η/∂xj2=0 and you **can** detect univariate curvature.

So you can compute, per feature and per pair:

- **Univariate score:** Uj=median⁡x∣∂2η/∂xj2∣U_j=\operatorname{median}_{x} \bigl|\partial^2\eta/\partial x_j^2\bigr|Uj=medianx∂2η/∂xj2
- **Interaction score:** Ijk=median⁡x∣∂2η/∂xj ∂xk∣I_{jk}=\operatorname{median}_{x}\bigl|\partial^2\eta/\partial x_j\,\partial x_k\bigr|Ijk=medianx∂2η/∂xj∂xk

Compare the total mass ∑jUj\sum_j U_j∑jUj vs ∑j<kIjk\sum_{j<k} I_{jk}∑j<kIjk (and the top entries) to say “this dataset is interaction-dominated” vs “univariate curvature is present.”

1. **Model-agnostic cross-check (report alongside derivatives).**
- **Friedman’s HHH-statistic** (from PDPs/ALE) for each pair (j,k)(j,k)(j,k): high HHH ⇒ interaction; low HHH and wiggly 1-D ALE ⇒ mostly univariate nonlinearity.
- **ICE fans conditioned on a partner.** If ICE curves of xjx_jxj **fan out** across bins of xkx_kxk, that’s interaction; if they’re parallel but curved, that’s univariate nonlinearity.
- **GAM surrogate test.** Fit a GAM with only fj(xj)f_j(x_j)fj(xj) splines; then add pairwise fjk(xj,xk)f_{jk}(x_j,x_k)fjk(xj,xk). If test loss drops mainly when adding fjkf_{jk}fjk, it’s interaction; if 1-D splines already capture it, it’s univariate.

### What to conclude with your current NIMO

- If you enforce **strict no-self**, NIMO’s corrections encode **interactions only**. Then you should expect Uj≈0U_j\approx 0Uj≈0 and focus on IjkI_{jk}Ijk.
- In your **relaxed** version, do both: report UjU_jUj and IjkI_{jk}Ijk. If IjkI_{jk}Ijk dominates (strong blocks in the interaction heatmap; big mixed partials), you can say “the gains are interaction-driven.” If several UjU_jUj are non-negligible while IjkI_{jk}Ijk is small, you can say “there’s evidence of univariate curvature.”

### Minimal recipe to drop into your pipeline

- Compute all derivatives with autograd on the **logit η\etaη** (not the probability).
- Summarize with medians (or means) over the validation set; show a **bar plot of UjU_jUj** and a **heatmap of IjkI_{jk}Ijk**.
- Add one **ICE/ALE panel** for a top feature and a **2-D surface** for a top pair to visually confirm.

This gives you a principled, quantitative way to **say what kind of structure** your hybrid is actually exploiting—rather than only showing that it performs well.
